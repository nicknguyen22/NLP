        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we embark on a journey into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the fascinating realm of sentiment analysis. Our focus will be on lexicon-based sentiment analysis, harnessed through the formidable tool known as Vader ('Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning').\n",
        "\n",
        "NLP stands at the crossroads of computer science and linguistics, aiming to equip computers with the capability to comprehend and interpret human language. Within this field, sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role, enabling us to discern the emotional tone and sentiments expressed within textual data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vader, an open-source software, accompanies us as a trusted ally on this analytical odyssey. Remarkably, it offers the flexibility for you to examine and tailor its code to align with your specific requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this week's lab sessions, our central emphasis will revolve around the lexicon, an integral component in sentiment analysis. We shall delve into how Vader effectively harnesses this lexicon to assign sentiment scores to text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To kickstart our exploration into the domain of NLP-based sentiment analysis using Vader, the subsequent cells will perform the necessary tasks of importing essential libraries and instantiating a SentimentIntensityAnalyzer object."

        "\n",
        "While compound scores tend to be reasonably accurate in many cases, their accuracy diminishes when applied to lengthy texts, hovering at around 65%. It's important to note that software like Vader performs optimally when dealing with shorter texts, which aligns with its original design intent. This observation leads us to explore some of the challenges and limitations inherent in deriving overall sentiment scores through a lexicon-based approach, shedding light on the complexities of sentiment measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Examining Sentiment Scores on a Sentence Level\n",
        "\n",
        "To gain deeper insights, let's consider the nuances of sentiment within individual sentences. To illustrate this, we will examine a review of Neil Jordan's film, \"The Butcher Boy,\" specifically sourced from the file named `cv079_11933.txt`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within this review, we encounter two distinct frames of reference through which sentiments can be connected:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Descriptive Statements:** These statements provide insights into the film's content. For instance, in sentence 3, we find the description: \"Francie is a 'sick, needy child'\"—this conveys what occurs in the film.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Analytic Statements:** In contrast, analytic statements delve into the examination and analysis of the film's content. Sentence 3 also offers an example: \"I found it difficult to laugh at some of Francie's darkly comic shenanigans.\" Here, the reviewer is critically analysing the film's impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to acknowledge that these distinctions are not always clear-cut. Both types of statements can incorporate evaluative language and provide indications of the reviewer's perspective on the movie. Nevertheless, a key takeaway is that lexicon-based sentiment analysis can encounter challenges when a review contains a substantial amount of \"negative\" content but still receives a positive overall assessment."
